"A density-matching approach for optimization under uncertainty"

Pranay Seshadri, Paul Constantine, Gianluca Iaccarino, Geoffrey Parks


Description of airfoil problem
Uncertainty: Inlet Mach number [0.66,0.69] with a beta(2,2)
Design Parameters: 16 Hicks-Henne bump function amplitudes (8 suction side, 8 pressure side)
Objective: Minimize distance to a target


MATLAB and python utilities for a NACA0012 optimization under uncertainty problem. 
WARNING: Work in progress.
